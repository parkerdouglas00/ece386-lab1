# Digits Client

The client connects to the server, gets a filepath from the user, sends an image to the server via a post request. The client receives an integer as a response from the server and displays it to the user.

## Usage

Input the IP address of the server to connect to the server, then input the filepath of the test image to pass the test image to the server. The integer that is output is the most probably digit contained in the test image.
